# PowerShell MCP - PSMCP

Transform your PowerShell scripts into intelligent, AI-driven services that respond to natural language. 
PowerShell Model Context Protocol (PSMCP) bridges the gap between your code and large language models, enabling seamless AI-human-code collaboration without complex configuration.

No YAML, no friction. Just prompts, tools, and instant execution.
It's not automation. It's collaboration.

## In Action
üîß What you'll see:

‚òëÔ∏èUsing New-MCP to scaffold a working AI server

‚òëÔ∏èIntegration with GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode

‚òëÔ∏èLive demo: Add a PowerShell function, restart the server, and the AI just knows

This isn‚Äôt just code‚Äîit‚Äôs a conversation.

## Install PSMCP

```
Install-Module PSMCP 

New-MCP d:\temp\testMCP
code-insiders d:\temp\testMCP
```

## Install VS Code 

To use PSMCP effectively, you'll need VS Code v1.99.3 or later. Here's how to install it:

1. Visit the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

## Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code

This guide walks you through setting up GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code. To use Copilot in VS Code, you need to have access to GitHub Copilot with your GitHub account.

## Getting Started with PSMCP

### New MCP

Start by creating a new MCP server with a simple command. This scaffolds the necessary files and sets the stage for dynamic AI interaction.

Once initialized, you're ready to configure your MCP tools‚Äîno YAML, no fuss.

### MCP JSON

The JSON file defines your available tools. In this example, we‚Äôre creating a simple Invoke-Addition function.

Clicking "Start" embeds the tool definition into the MCP config. Now it‚Äôs registered and ready to go.

## After Clicking Start

With the tool registered, starting the server wires up everything under the hood.

The server is hot and listening. Now you can talk to your code like it‚Äôs a teammate.

### Let's Prompt

Time to interact. Drop a natural language prompt and let the AI figure out which function to use.

Your intent is recognized‚Äîand the AI knows exactly what tool to invoke.

### Copilot Wants to Run your function

Copilot steps in, proposing to call your registered function based on your prompt.

Confirm to execute and let the AI orchestrate the rest.

## Expand the Run

Peek under the hood‚Äîsee the actual arguments passed to your function.

Confirm to execute and let the AI orchestrate the rest.

### After Run

Execution complete. The function ran with your inputs, and now you get the result.

This isn‚Äôt just code‚Äîit‚Äôs a conversation. One prompt, one response, and a world of automation opens up.

## Creating your own Functions

Edit the <yourMCPServerName.ps1> file adding your functions. 

*TIPS:*

- Write Help/Comments for your functions that describes what the function does, example(s) and outputs. This will help your MCP Client discover the capabilities and use the functions how you intended.
- Make your Functions Global. (e.g. functionName Global:Get-myFunction {})
- At the bottom of your <yourMCPServerName.ps1> add each function comma seperated so that they will be availabile in your MCP Client (e.g. VSCode)

üü® Conclusion
This workflow redefines how we build and run tools. From scaffolding an MCP server to interacting with it using plain language, the line between prompt and program is disappearing.

No more brittle glue code. No more hand-rolling APIs. Just describe what you want, and your AI-enhanced PowerShell server takes it from there‚Äîregistering, invoking, and summarizing functions on demand.

Welcome to the future of coding.
It‚Äôs not just execution‚Äîit‚Äôs collaboration.
